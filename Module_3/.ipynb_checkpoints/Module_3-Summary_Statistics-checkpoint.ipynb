    "$\\bullet$ In general, most functions that calculate something will automatically print their result, unless we give that result a name. This means that we do not need to use the \"print()\" function unless we save the result of a calculation with a name <br />\n",
    "$\\bullet$ We extract a variable from a data frame using \"\\$\". For example, we extract the \"Weight\" variable from the data frame \"data.cfsb\" by typing \"data.cfsb\\$Weight\" <br />\n",
    "$\\bullet$ In R, capital letters and small letters are distinct. This means that \"Weight\" and \"weight\" are different variables <br />\n",
    "$\\bullet$ If a function only has one input, then we do not need to specify the name of that input. For example, instead of \"read.csv(file = \"CFSB.csv\")\", we could write \"read.csv(\"CFSB.csv\")\""
