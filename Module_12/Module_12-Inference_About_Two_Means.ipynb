    "In this module, we discuss how to test whether two populations have the same mean. We expand upon the matched pairs T-test from Module 11 to allow for independent samples from the two populations. We also show how to find a confidence interval for the difference between these two populations' means."

    "The null hypothesis that we will be testing in this module is that the means of our two populations are the same. An equivalent way to say this is that the difference between the two population means is zero. The alternatives that we consider are that the difference between these two means is less than zero, greater than zero or not equal to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Saying that the difference is less than zero depends on the order of the means when we subtract them. Therefore, we have to be careful when specifying the order of our means in R functions to make sure that our alternative hypothesis is saying what we think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first T-test that we look at in this module is simply called the two-sample T-test. This test does not require that our data come in pairs, making it applicable in many more situations than the matched pairs T-test from Module 11. The two-sample T-test also makes no assumptions about the variances of our two populations. That is, we allow the populations' variances to be different. \n",
    "\n",
    "We carry out the two-sample T-test in R using the \"t.test()\" function. We will use many of the same inputs that we discussed in Module 11, so check back there for more details. In particular, we use \"x\", \"y\", \"alternative\" and \"conf.level\". We are now working with unpaired data, so we could set \"paired\" to \"FALSE\". The default value of \"paired\" is \"FALSE\" however, so we can just omit this input.\n",

    "The following code cell has independent samples from two different populations. Let's use a two-sample T-test to test the null hypothesis that these populations have the same mean versus the alternative hypothesis that their means are dbifferent. "
