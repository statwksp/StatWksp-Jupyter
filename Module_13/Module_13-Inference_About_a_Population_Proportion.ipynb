When working with a population proportion, our estimate is $\\hat{p}$, our standard error is $\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}$ and our critical value is from a standard normal. This confidence interval is a hybrid of the ones we used in Modules 10 and 11, where we have to estimate the standard error of our estimate, but we still use a standard normal critical value because we have assumed that our sample is large (T-distributions with large degrees of freedom are close to the standard normal).\n",

The 2011 Canadian census found that $68.5\\%$ of the $33476685$ people living in Canada are between 15 and 64. Taking Canada as a sample of the entire world (which admittely is probably not a great idea), let's make a $99.9\\%$ confidence interval for the proportion of people worldwide that are between 15 and 64 years old."
