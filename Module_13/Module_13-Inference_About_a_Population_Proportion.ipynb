Our estimate of the population proportion is $\\hat{p}$, our standard error is $\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})/n}$ and our critical value is from a standard normal. This confidence interval is similar to the ones we used in Modules 10 and 11, where we have to estimate the standard error of our estimate, but here we use a standard normal critical value because we have assumed that our sample is large.\n",

The 2011 Canadian census found that $68.5\\%$ of the $33476685$ people living in Canada are between 15 and 64. Taking Canada as a sample of the entire world (which admittedly is probably not a great idea), let's make a $99.9\\%$ confidence interval for the proportion of people worldwide that are between 15 and 64 years old."
