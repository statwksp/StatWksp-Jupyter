    "It is often useful to be able to generate a simple random sample from a dataset. This may be to choose a sample from our population, or to choose a group from our sample that will receive some treatment. Regardless of what we plan to do with our sample, we generate it in R using the same procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that we use for random sampling in R is called \"sample()\". The \"sample()\" function generates random numbers that we then use to pick individuals from a list. The \"sample()\" function has two inputs, \"x\" and \"size\". The \"x\" input is the number of individuals that we want to sample from. The \"size\" input is the number of individuals that we want to select. \n",
    "\n",
