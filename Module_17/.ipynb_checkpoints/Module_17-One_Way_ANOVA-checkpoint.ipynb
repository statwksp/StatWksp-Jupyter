We can check this assumption by calculating the sample standard deviation of each group and checking whether the largest is more than double the smallest. If the ratio between the largest and smallest sample standard deviations is more than two, then we conclude that the population standard deviations are too different for an ANOVA F-test to be valid. If this ratio is less than two, we are not able to say that the population standard deviations are different, so we assume that they are similar enough to carry out our analysis.\n",

The \"data\" input tells R which values to work with. Note that, in the \"by()\" function, \"data\" is a list of values, not a data frame. The \"INDICES\" input tells R which group each value in \"data\" belongs to. The \"FUN\" input tells R what function to apply to each group.\n",
