We are able to do this because all randomness in R is actually pseudo-random. The procedure that R uses to generate pseudo-random numbers is actually not random at all, just really complicated. R uses a 'random seed' to determine where to start this complicated procedure for generating pseudo-random numbers. If we fix the random seed, then we will get the same 'random' numbers every time. We can fix the random seed in R using the \"set.seed()\" function. \n",
