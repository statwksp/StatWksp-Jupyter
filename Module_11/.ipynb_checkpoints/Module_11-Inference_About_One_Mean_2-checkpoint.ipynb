    "The T-confidence interval requires that we assume our data are normally distributed, but we do not need to know the standard deviation of this normal distribution. We instead estimate the population standard deviation with the sample standard deviation. Replacing the known standard deviation with an estimate changes the distribution of our procedure, so we have to use the critical value from a T-distribution instead of from a standard normal.\n",

    "The T-distribution has an extra number associated with it called the degrees of freedom. For all the inference in this module, the degrees of freedom for our T-distribution will be the sample size minus 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the critical value from a T-distribution in R using the \"qt()\" function. This function behaves similarly to the \"qnorm()\" function from Module 5. The \"qt()\" function has two inputs: \"p\" and \"df\". The \"p\" input is a probability, and \"qt()\" gives us the point that has \"p\" probability below it. The \"df\" input is the degrees of freedom for our T-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that confidence intervals are of the form: estimate $\\pm$ critical value $*$ standard error. For T-confidence intervals, the estimate is $\\bar{x}$, the sample mean, the critical value is from a T-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the sample size minus 1, and the standard error is $s/\\sqrt{n}$, the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",

Remember that we read datasets into R using the \"read.csv()\" function. The first row of this file is the name of our variable, so we can set \"header=T\", or just omit \"header\"."
